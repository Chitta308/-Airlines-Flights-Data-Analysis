## ✈ Airlines Flights Data Analysis – Uncovering Insights from Real-World Data 📊

I recently completed a deep dive into a dataset of airline flights in India to explore how pricing, duration, and travel choices vary across airlines.

## 🔍 Key Highlights:
Compared ticket prices across different airlines and travel classes
Analyzed how departure times and days left before travel impact pricing
Identified trends in non-stop vs stop flights and their effect on travel duration
Visualized insights using Seaborn & Matplotlib for clear storytelling

## 🔍 Key Questions I Answered:
1.Which airline offers the lowest and highest average ticket prices?
2.How do ticket prices change by travel class (Economy vs Business)?
3.Does booking earlier result in cheaper tickets?
4.How does departure time (Morning, Evening, Night) impact pricing?
5.Which routes have the highest average prices?
6.What’s the average duration for zero-stop vs one-stop flights?
7.Which airlines dominate certain source cities?
8.Does days left before travel significantly influence price?
9.Is there a difference in travel duration across airlines for the same route?
10.Which airline offers the most competitive Business Class fares?

## 📈 Skills & Tools Used:
 Python | Pandas | Matplotlib | Seaborn | Data Cleaning | Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

💡 This project showed how multiple factors — airline choice, booking window, flight type, and timing — combine to influence ticket pricing. Insights like these can help travelers make smarter booking decisions and airlines optimize strategies.
